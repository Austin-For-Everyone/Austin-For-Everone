# How to Use Your Voice to Support Housing at Public Meetings

It's not always easy being a YIMBY. Public meetings about new developments usually attract the most vocal opponents, even if most people are happy to welcome their new neighbors.

However, your courageous voice can have a huge impact at public meetings.

## Why Should You Speak Up?

Good question! When you speak up, you:

- Welcome people into your neighborhood -- people often lose sight of the fact that the future residents of a given project are also stakeholders, and without your support they don't get a say in this process.

- Enable city planning staff to put forward a balanced report to Council Committees or other decision-makers.

- Give your Councilmember the courage to do the right thing, and create opportunity in your community.

- Curb the most extreme opponents, and give both council and other residents an alternative way of viewing the proposed development.

## Tips for Speaking at Public Meetings

### Make Yourself Known

Contact the organization making the development proposal. The organization may have information and background research that they have done that will help to strengthen your remarks. City Council often wants to see that the developer is doing community outreach, so adding your voice to the discussion before the meeting can help with that.

To make contact, you can look up the property on the [City of Austin's Public Search](https://abc.austintexas.gov/web/permit/public-search-other?reset=true) tool and seeing who requested the permit.

### Invite Your Friends

At public meetings, numbers count. These meetings can also be difficult sometimes, and it's always good to have some company.

### Come As You Are, Speak from the Heart

You do not need to be an expert on housing or city planning issues to speak up. Just speak about what you know.

- If you live nearby, describe how the proposal will improve the property or contribute to the neighborhood.

- If you are a business owner, you might describe how the new development would benefit your business. New residents means more potential customers!

- If you, a family member, or a friend has been homeless or is on a housing waiting list, talk about what it is like to wait for years for a decent home and proper supports.

- If you are a member of a congregation in the area, speak up for social justice, or for members of your own congregation who need a place to live.

### Try to Speak Early in the Meeting

Your positive voice can encourage other supporters and temper the more extreme opponents. If you happen to go later, take advantage of the delay. Use your remarks to address some of the concerns raised earlier in the meeting.

### Don't Get in to Arguments

If others try to argue or heckle while you are speaking, appeal to the chairperson for order.

### At the End of the Meeting

At the end of the meeting, try ot speak to City Councilmembers or city staff. Ask them whether there will be other opportunities to support this development, and what you could do to help move the conversation forward.

## After the Meeting

Send a letter summing up the points you made at the meeting (and all the things you though of after you left!) to your Councilmember and the city staff person responsible for the meeting. Don't forget to send a copy to the sponsoring development organization.
