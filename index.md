## The future of Texas's capital city depends on you.

Austin for Everyone is an independent project run by individuals that support land use polices that will help provide abundant, diverse, and affordable housing options in all of Austin's neighborhoods. We organize our current and future neighbors to encourage Austin City Council and other civic leaders to make inclusive and equitable land use and funding decisions that will:

- Provide plenty of affordable and diverse housing options in every Austin neighborhood
- Prioritize investments for historically and currently under-served populations
- Encourage housing for our new friends and neighbors over the storage of cars
- Allow more people to live in areas with good access to transportation, parks, and services
- Foster and sustain economically diverse neighborhoods

While we have ideas for how to achieve these goals, we are open to suggestions and are always looking to learn and discuss productively.

## Ways to Get Involved

### Write an Op-Ed or a Letter to the Editor

One of the most critical actions you can take is to help set the tone of the conversation on the need for more units, especially more affordable units. We've put together a [short guide](/resources/letter-to-the-editor) to help you create your own. If you would like to see some examples or need some inspiration, check out our [resources](/resources) page.

### Get involved in Your Neighborhood

For a lot of reasons--some good, some not-so-good-- neighbhorhood associations have a lot of influence when it comes to a lot of issues, including housing and zoning. If you want to influence the conversation, then attending meetings, or even consider running for a leadership position. People of diverse backgrounds and opinions should be represented at every level of Austin's civic process.
